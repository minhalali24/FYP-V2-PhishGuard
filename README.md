What are "Ignored URLs"?
Ignored URLs are websites that you have personally decided to trust, even if PhishGuard warns you about them.

Why would you ignore a URL?
Sometimes PhishGuard might incorrectly warn you about a safe website. If this happens:

1. You see the warning
2. You recognize the website is actually safe
3. You click "Continue anyway"
4. That URL gets added to your Ignored URLs list

All detection and processing are performed locally within the browser. No external servers or third-party services are required.
